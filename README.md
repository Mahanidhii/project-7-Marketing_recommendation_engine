8. `git push --set-upstream origin master`, sends all the files from git to github.

Docker:
1. `docker build -t <file_name> .`
2. `docker run <folder_name`

### Steps:
1. Building the required files: app.py: flask code,
requirements.txt: contains required libraries,
marketing_recommendations.csv: The required dataset for this model, 
train_model.py: code to test the file,
Dockerfile: contains commands to be run in docker
2. Create a new item under Freestyle Project type in Jenkins.
3. Select Git in Source Code Management and paste your repository url in the given space
4. Add Execute windows batch command in Build Steps
5. Build now and visualize console output
6. Open command prompt with the directory of the folder with the required file
7. Run the docker commands mentioned above
8. Visualize the output in both command prompt and Docker desktop app
